We now fully support Gopher and Gemini hosting. Regular users would of notice the appearance of `public_gopher` and `public_gemini` folders, which are hosted at their related endpoints:

* HTTPS: https://dimension.sh/~username
* Gopher: gopher://dimension.sh/1/~username
* Gemini: gemini://dimension.sh/~username

If you need an example Gophermap or GMI you can copy the files from `/etc/skel/`. New users will have these files available to them on account creation.
