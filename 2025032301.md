It has been a long time coming, but we're finally here.

I've received a few requests over the last week to get the OS updated, but I also took the step to migrate the system to a new host to try and reduce the costs a little. So our upcoming migration will be over to Rocky Linux 9, hosted by OVH in Canada.

The new IP is `51.79.51.59` and `2607:5300:205:200::5d6d`, and everyone's data is synced up to the current time (2025-03-23 10:00 UTC), so feel free to login and check everything out. We'll have a end date and final migration time decided in the next few days which will consist of a shutdown of all services and a final homedir sync to the new system. **You'll receive an email with further details nearer the time**.

Any questions or issues on the new system then feel free to drop a mail to `sysops@`
