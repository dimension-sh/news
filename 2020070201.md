I've just finished implementing a new NEWS system on the system, all accessible by the `news` command from your login! 

   * `news` or `news latest` will give you the latest post.
   * `news read` will let you browse the last 5.

Hopefully now it'll be a little bit easier to communicate out the changes to the system. All the code is available on our [GitHub organisation](https://github.com/dimension-sh) so if you have any suggestions or want to put some work into our system them check it out.
