This morning i've come across some packaging issues on `s1.dimension.sh`, hopefully nothing serious but I had to quite a bit of recovery work and reinstallations to get everything in a correct state. If you identify any issues then drop a mail to [sysops](mailto:sysops@dimension.sh) and i'll sort it out.
