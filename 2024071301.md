As CentOS 8 Stream has hit end of life, we're now facing the choice of what to upgrade to. With no official upgrade path supported, we're looking at a re-install to CentOS 9 or swapping to another supported EL distribution.

No fixed date for the upgrade is set, but we'll post on the website, the mailing list, and Mastodon when we decide. In the meanwhile, please backup your data! While we do keep encrypted backups of `/home` its best to have a personal backup of all your files as well.
