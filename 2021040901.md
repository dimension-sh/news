I've resolved an issue with the outbound SMTP server settings for Outlook clients, and it now accepts LOGIN authentication. If you have any further problems, then drop a mail to `root`.

If you're interested in using your email on an email client outside of the shell, then check out the [IMAP settings wiki page](https://dimension.sh/cgi/wiki.cgi?p=Accessing_your_email_via_IMAP).
