Tomorrow morning (2021/11/24) at around 07:00 UTC *s1.dimension.sh* will be patched and rebooted. This is your friendly warning to save any open files you have 
running in tmux sessions. 

After patching if you encounter any errors, drop a email to [sysops@dimension.sh](mailto:sysops@dimension.sh).
